Here we see English galleons being towed, or ???warped???, as it was called, towards the Spanish fleet by rowing boats. They can be seen firing broadsides and stern chasers as they are pulled in a narrow arc. Most death and destruction occurred on the decks. Few cannon balls could penetrate the hulls and where they did, the damage was patched up rapidly by the ship's carpenters." // Optional audio transcript, appears at the bottom of the overlay
