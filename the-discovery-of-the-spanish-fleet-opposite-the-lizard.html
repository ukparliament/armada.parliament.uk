Each man was expected to purchase his own weapons. Those in poorer areas especially would have been seriously under equipped and would have been no match for the veteran soldiers and mercenaries from Spain and the Netherlands. As the Armada sailed east along the English Channel, the trained bands were meant to track the fleet from the coast and join up with those of the neighbouring counties once they left their own.
