Each man was expected to purchase his own weapons. Those in poorer areas especially would have been seriously under equipped and would have been no match for the veteran soldiers and mercenaries from Spain and the Netherlands. As the Armada sailed east along the English Channel, the trained bands were meant to track the fleet from the coast and join up with those of the neighbouring counties once they left their own. In practice, once they got to the eastern border of their own county, most returned to their land to bring in the harvest." // Optional audio transcript, appears at the bottom of the overlay
