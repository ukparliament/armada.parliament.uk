                        <p>Lead artist Anthony Oakshett was ideally placed to succeed in the ambitious Armada Paintings project. An experienced observational painter and portraitist. He also had previous experience working on a large scale. His skill as an expert copyist of historic paintings gave him the visual acuity needed to respond to Richard Burchett’s style. His training as an art historian was invaluable, too, in researching missing details about the appearance of English and Spanish ships. Anthony Oakshett gives a flavour of the unique challenges of the project, commenting on his thought processes over the portrait heads in the decorative borders:</p>
                        <p><em>"While painting these portraits, I often reflected that I was a twenty-first century artist, creating portraits of sixteenth century men, in the style of a nineteenth century artist, based on eighteenth century engravings."</em></p>

                        <p>The first practical challenge of the Armada Paintings Project was to find a studio space big enough to accommodate the six sizeable canvases together. After extensive searches an industrial building was identified in the grounds of Wrest Park, an 1830s country house set in important gardens dating from the 17th century, and managed by English Heritage.</p>

This collaborative system was similar to the historic studio, where an established artist employed and trained assistants. During the Armada Paintings project, all the artists shared challenges, learning new approaches from each other in a dynamic and collaborative way.</p>

                        <p>Bill Clibery’s skills were key to enlarging the tiny engraved designs onto massive canvases. He says, ‘Although there were challenges; these were approached with a troubleshooting attitude that made the process enjoyable…in beginning to translate the Pine engravings to linear plans at the correct scale, the level of detail to be cleaned up and added became apparent, and the stamina we were to need...one of the best moments was sitting back at my desk and viewing the completion of the first digital linear plan, seeing the overall composition, and being able to imagine the finished work.’.</p>

He was a sculptor’s assistant working on church and public commissions, and trained as a digital graphic designer at Central St Martin’s in London, practising in publicity and urban design. Inspired by David Hockney’s book, ‘Secret Knowledge’ – about how Old Masters used up to date technologies to make accurate likeness – he began to use software to combine handmade drawings with digital structures. </p>

                        <p>A specialist muralist and trompe l’oeil painter for over 20 years before the Armada Project, Colin Failes is adept at both large scale and detailed work. He began as an apprentice engineering draughtsman, was assistant to a portrait and landscape painter, then studied at the City and Guilds Art School, and qualified as a postgraduate at the Royal Academy of Arts in London. He was a tutor at Harrow College of Art.</p>
                        <p>A team member throughout the project, Colin Failes collaborated on the paintings’ borders with Anthony Oakshett and Ruijun Hu, but the large coats of arms fell to him alone. They were ‘a challenge’, he says as, ‘all five had to be identical and match the one in the Burchett painting…about 35 cm x 65 cm…much of the detail was done using a head mounted magnifying glass.’ Then in the final stages he, ‘did miles and miles of rigging, and countless flags and pennants on the ships’.</p>

His work for the Armada Project won much media attention in China, and acclaim from the art sector. Ruijun has exhibited in the first UK Biennial exhibition of Chinese artists in London and in a solo show at the Gu Yuan Museum of Art, Zhu Hai, China.</p>
                        <p>As a painter in the studio for the entire two years, Ruijun Hu was involved in the whole process, from tracing images to glazing the completed paintings. He reflects, ‘The Armada Project’s immense scale meant that it was impossible for any single artist to complete; therefore, teamwork was extremely important’, and remembers Anthony Oakshett as an ‘outstanding’ leader, providing ‘meticulous preparation coupled with efficient working arrangements. The artists ‘all respected each other’s working methods, exchanging ideas until we had mutual understanding’, and became good friends. </p>

                        <p>Alessia Jones describes working on one of the massive paintings, ‘Sitting on planks of wood high above the ground with my palette, paintbrushes, linseed oil and a cup of tea was a bit like being in a little nest’. Then, ‘When it came to painting the boats they took many layers of paint to realise. I painted around six on each before Anthony would add all the finest details, glazes and scumbling. I remember the precision with which each cannon was spaced and measured: it was painstaking.’ Alessia was involved in the project for four months and remembers it fondly.</p>

He was included in the Jerwood Contemporary Painters exhibition. Oils are Robin’s preferred medium, and he has worked on a large scale, so was undaunted when he joined midway through the Armada Project.</p>
                        <p>Using computer screens up scaffolding, Robin Dixon recalls, ‘meant that we could refer to the particular photographs of each sequence of the existing border without moving from the task in hand’. He says, ‘developing some parts was particularly satisfying, such as the frames for the portraits. When we put the second coat on, [they] looked amazingly three-dimensional. I remember sometimes feeling a real sense of achievement at having progressed another foot or two along the border. What impressed me at the end was the way the paintings had a visually unified feel…the cumulative power of all the elements involved in the paintings.’.</p>

In a diverse career, she has contributed to the Feme Fuse event in Cornwall, staged a solo exhibition ‘The Lioness, Woman and the Wardrobe’ and designed costumes for the dance company Shallal.</p>
                        <p>During her four months on the project, Emily Harnett recalls, ‘the location was beautiful and inspiring. Wrest Park in winter, an empty country garden. A lunchtime walk kept a fresh and clear approach to painting.’ Working with Alessia on two blank canvases, ‘we used the ready mixed palette of oils matched to the Burchett painting and gradually built up about four layers on the water and land sections’. ‘The sky was left to Anthony’s experienced eye’, he ‘taught me a lot in discussions about quality materials and detail’. Later, Emily returned to Falmouth, ‘I look at the harbour and remember the paintings. The water is very calm there even when there are storms.’</p>

                        <p>As Burchett had already selected the scene at Fowey from Pine’s engravings, the House of Lords chose a further five subjects from the nine remaining engravings for the new paintings. Minute by comparison to the original tapestries, the engravings lacked much of the fine detail and gave no information about colour as they were printed in black and white.</p>

                        <p>This image superimposes Burchett’s painting over Pine’s engraving of the same subject. The fact that the engraving was proportionally shorter is clear, as its top runs close to the line of hills, and the Royal coat of arms hovers over the sea. By extending the format of the composition upwards, Burchett was being more faithful to the appearance of the tapestries. Like him, Anthony Oakshett had to fill the differently shaped empty wall compartments in the Prince’s Chamber, and needed to work out a method of building upon Pine’s designs.  </p>

                        <p>A careful comparison of these details from Pine’s engraving and Anthony Oakshett’s painting shows that the Armada project artists had to adapt the design so that the enlarged scene appeared convincing. This entailed first checking whether the ships looked accurate. Anthony’s research into 16th century ships enabled him to understand the correct structures of the different types of vessel deployed during the Armada campaign. In addition, specialist guidance was available from a team of academics. Agreeing and implementing changes to the detail of Pine’s designs was a collaborative effort, involving Anthony, academics and the House of Lords project team.</p>

                        <p>To enlarge a design, traditionally artists have drawn a grid of squares over small drawings, and correspondingly larger squares on the support for their painting. Anthony faced the same challenge, and with Bill Clibery’s help used computer technology in a modern version of this process. In this image, one of Pine’s engravings has been digitally enlarged to match the scale of a wall compartment. Rather than making a grid of squares, it was decided to use A3 sized rectangles. This meant that standard A3 paper could be used to print out a ‘tile’ for copying to canvas.</p>

The design modifications made by Burchett were used for the borders of each of the five new paintings, so as to make the series consistent. This echoed the consistency of border design of each of the original tapestries. </p>

                        <h4>Methods of scaling up</h4>
                        <p>To enlarge a design, traditionally artists have drawn a grid of squares over small drawings, and correspondingly larger squares on the support for their painting. Anthony faced the same challenge, and with Bill Clibery’s help used computer technology in a modern version of this process. In this image, one of Pine’s engravings has been digitally enlarged to match the scale of a wall compartment. Rather than making a grid of squares, it was decided to use A3 sized rectangles. This meant that standard A3 paper could be used to print out a ‘tile’ for copying to canvas.</p>

                        <p>Ships are difficult to draw because they are complicated three dimensional objects. The curving line of a ship’s hull changes subtly when viewed from even slightly different positions. Painting on a large scale, it was necessary to include a great amount of detail about each ship. In building up the authentic appearance, including rigging, flags and armaments, Anthony Oakshett’s research proved invaluable.</p>

                        <p>As part of his modifications Burchett applied lettering to his designs, with painted strapwork decoration either side of the picture’s title. His ingenious presentation of the names of sitters in the portraits made the writing legible, even when the painting was hung high on the wall.</p>

                        <p>The Lord Admiral, Rear Admiral and four principal commanders (Seymour, Frobisher, Hawkins and Drake) appear along the border at the top of all six canvases. Various themes explain the selection of individuals depicted at the bottom of different paintings: naval administrators, the council of war, volunteers, senior commanders and heroes. When research failed to uncover portraits of Sir Henry Palmer and William Borough, it was decided that Lord Crathorne, Chairman of the Works of Art Committee at the time of the project, and Anthony Oakshett would step in as 21st century sitters.</p>
